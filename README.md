# Frontend Mentor - Tip calculator app
Created a Tip Calculator based on the design requirements, using Javascript ES6 , HTML and CSS.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

# Learnings 
I learnt why we use !important to override the other styles applied to the element previously. 
I am still learning how to create the functions. 
I learnt how the below statements to check if all the inputs are given, in order to calculate the results.
if(!billAmount || !tipValue || !people) 
        return  { totalTipPerPerson: 0 , totalSplitPerPerson: 0}
